# Movies in time

*Remark : the Jupyter notebook was too large to be visualized in github. Use github dev environment to see it (when you try to visualize it and it says too big, click on the top right drop down and pick github.dev*

***Abstract***

We think that there are some correlations between a movie’s success (box office, Oscars and rating) and its release date within different time-frames and that the producers know it, and exploit it. There are some obvious trends that are common knowledge such as the blockbuster season, but we would like to look at more specific, local and unexplained trends in movie releases. Our goal is to show how we are influenced by time in our perception of movies, and what are the strategies movie studios use to benefit from this bias or what they get wrong, whether it's expressed within a month, a year, a decade or a lifetime. This could then be useful data for studios on what to avoid and what to look for when choosing the release date of a movie. To this end, we need to ask ourselves a couple of questions.


## Research questions

- Can we find any trends in movie release dates within a month, a year, and are there dates or periods that producers avoid ?

- What are the correlations between the release month and the box office performance ? Do these correlations change across history ? 

- Is there a causal effect of the release month on the box office performance ? If yes, does it change across countries ? 

- Is there a causal effect of the period of release (week, month, day of the week, etc.) on the box office performance ? 

- Is there a causal effect of the season of release on the amount of Oscars won ? What is the best way to define season in that context (i.e. what are the best dates that constitute a season when it comes to Oscar winning trends) ?


## Proposed additional datasets
- "The Movies Dataset" from Kaggle : This dataset’s content is very similar to the CMU dataset’s, which here works to our advantage because we used to complete missing data in our dataset. This allows us to work with a more robust dataset and broaden the scope of our analysis.

- "IMDB Dataset" from Kaggle : Gross isn’t a sufficient metric to evaluate public perception, which in our analysis, is critical. That’s where this additional dataset comes in. It offers key indicators of a movie’s success not present in our initial dataset, such as average rating and the volume of votes a movie received.

- "The Oscar Award, 1927-2023" from Kaggle : This dataset features Oscar wins and nominations, which is a significant measure of a movie's acclaim and success. Moreover, this attribute is often closely correlated with the film's release date, offering a temporal dimension to the success metrics in our analysis. This dataset contains the movies rewarded each year and for each category.



## Proposed timeline

week 0. 13 Nov 2023 ~ 19 Nov 2023\
week 1. finish homework 2 before Friday. Have a meeting with the supervisor on Friday to talk about the research method\
week 2. learn about how to create a website using github and go deeper into our analysis. \
week 3. get feedback from milestone 2 and precise our research questions. \
week 4. devolpe the website and finalize the analysis. \
week 5. cleanup of the jupyter notebook, finish website and readme.

Note: have meeting with the superviser each week.
