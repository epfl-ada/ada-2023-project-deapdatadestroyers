# TITLE

***Abstract***

All things on earth exist under the cold cruel hands of father Time, and the movie industry is no exception. It’d be easy to think that we, as intelligent beings, are above the concept of temporal bias, that the weather has no influence on our perception of movies and that in the Oscar season, the movie we vouch for is obviously our favorite, and not just the freshest in our memory. In actuality, our perception of a movie, just as our perception of a meal, can be very contextual, and what better context than time itself. We think that there are some correlations between a movie’s success and its release date within different time-frames and that the producers know it, and exploit it. Our goal is to show how us simple creatures are influenced by time in our perception of movies, and what are the strategies movie studios use to benefit from this bias, whether it's expressed within a month, a year, a decade or a lifetime. To this end, we need to ask ourselves a couple of questions. 


## Research questions

-Can we find any trends in movie release dates within a month, a year, and are there dates or periods that producers avoid ?


-Do these trends change across countries ? across history ?


-What influence does the release date of a movie within a month/year have on its score and gross ?


-Do certain genres favor certain periods of the year ? (e.g: Horror at Halloween, family movies at Christmas) 


-Does the amount of time between a movie’s release date and Oscar nominations influence its chances to be nominated and/or win ?


## Proposed addtional datasets 
- "The Movies Dataset" from Kaggle : This dataset ressembles the one of CMU in terms of contents. We used this dataset to enrich the CMU dataset by filling its missing values. This would allow us to increase the robustness of the CMU dataset but also to expand and broadened our scope for analysis. It provided us with the means to conduct deeper and more precise evaluations of the cinematic information at hand.

- "IMDB Dataset" from Kaggle : This dataset offers a wealth of information, including critical metrics like movie ratings and the volume of votes in line with IMDB standards. Such data points are key indicators of a film's success and popularity, providing valuable insights not present in the initial dataset.

- "The Oscar Award, 1927-2023" from Kaggle : This dataset features Oscar wins and nominations which is a significant measure of a movie's acclaim and success. Moreover, this attribute is often closely correlated with the film's release date, offering a temporal dimension to the success metrics in our analysis. This dataset contains the movies rewarded each year and for each category.
